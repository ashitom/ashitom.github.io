# Introduction 

My name is Tom Ashi. I have over 17 years of digital transformation experience, starting out as a software developer with the defunct Diamond Bank plc of Nigeria, during which I developed the first Nigerian bespoke application for global trade, nicknamed Trade Tracker. After 5 years, I transitioned to a Business Process Management (BPM) role, where I led the bank's rapid retail expansion strategy and improved daily customer acquisition from 1000 accounts per day to over 12000 accounts per day, by implementing and operating a BPM solution in partnership with Newgen Software Technologies of India.

More recently, I have led digital transformation projects as a Project Manager and Business Analyst, of which the implementation of the first fingerprint biometric customer identity solution for in-branch banking services in Nigeria stands out.
# What I do now.
I am a growing data scientist. My learning over the years have been a great foundation for this transition. I am rapidly learning how to write algorithms for exploring data to uncover patterns that have business value. The goal is to help organisations and individuals make better use of data they generate everyday to improve existing services/products or create new ones and to support their strategic decision making. My interest in optimization extends to building machines that can automate tasks...hopefully I can help automate some boring activities so that mankind can focus more on critical thinking :)
